    "Just for a minute, put yourself in the shoes (or boots) of an archaeologist exploring the jungles of South America in search of lost treasure. Running across a pyramid-shaped structure, you gingerly step inside, careful not to trigger any hidden booby traps. Inside, you see three long and dark corridors leading in different directions. Your capable assistant back in base camp radios you, confirming that the treasure you seek lies within this pyramid, down one of the three paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "With thoughts of fame and riches in your mind, you start down the left-most of the three paths. With little more than a torch to guide light your way, you have no idea if this is even the right path. Fueled by excitement, you continue your journey down the path, stopping only when you run into a dead-end two hours later. \"Drats!\", you curse, \"that was a waste of time\". Two hours of back-tracking later, you are back at square one. Unwilling to give up, you start down the second path, only this time the trip takes twice as long, still yielding nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A grand total of twelve hours later, you are back at where you started, utterly exhausted and absolutely drained of whatever enthusiasm you had in the first place. You decide to give it one last shot, and explore the last path. Not even five minutes into your trek, you notice a twinkle in the darkness up ahead. You've found the lost treasure!\n",
    "\n",
    "On your helicopter ride back to civilisation, you wonder if you could have tackled the problem in a different way. If only there was a way to check for shorter paths first, before going all the way down the rabbit hole for naught. "
